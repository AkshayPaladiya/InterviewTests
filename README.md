A junior developer has just accomplished a task suspicously fast...and went for lunch.
There are now unit tests breaking on the build server and only you have the skills to fix it.

You should 

  - Fork this repo
  - Fix the broken unit test
  - make sure there is adequate test coverage
  - make sure all code is SOLID!!!
  - favor imparitive over declaritive programming
  
  
When finished, make a pull request against the master branch.
