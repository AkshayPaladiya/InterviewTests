A junior developer has just accomplished a task suspicously fast...and went for lunch.
There are now unit tests breaking on the build server and only you have the skills to fix it.

You should 

  - Fork this repo
  - Fix the broken unit test
  - make sure there is adequate test coverage. If there is not, write enough unit tests until you are satisfied there is enough coverage
  - favor imperative over declaritive programming (eg. use LINQ)
  - make sure all code is clean and of the highest quality 
  - all code must adhere to SOLID principles!!!
   
  
When finished, make a pull request against the master branch.
